# Searchable Table in ReactJs

**React components** are the building blocks of a React application. To build a React UI, you first break it down into a component hierarchy, then build a static version of the app, and finally add interactivity by managing state.
The key steps are:
1. Break the UI into a component hierarchy
2. Build a static version in React without using state
3. Identify the minimal but complete representation of UI state
4. Determine where the state should live in the component hierarchy
5. Implement two-way data flow between the state and the UI

This is an example of building a searchable product data table, demonstrating how to apply these principles. It it implements topics like one-way data flow, the difference between props and state, and how to pass callbacks from parent to child components to enable updating the state.
